    <h1>Attractor</h1>
    <p>What is an attractor? At its core it is a filter mechanism on Deep Inquiry Framework sites to help people discover profiles, providers, products, or insights more resonantly than a filter controlled by an algorithm to influence the discovery process for monetary gain.<br><br>
The goal is to provide agency over both the curation and creation of the experiences as well as the consumption of it. This is what will be unique about the attractor where both sides of the exchange will be empowered to help tune the experiences to the communities served.
<br><br>
Whether these communities are open source developers, civic leaders and workers or creatives who are interested in challenging the norms of discovery, I plan on making the case it is time to evolve from an influenced exchange to one that is built more on the attracting forces of curiosity and deep engagement. 
<br><br>
My next work on the Framework will be to create a database of records I can then integrate into the DIFs I am building. Once this is completed, I will begin work on the attractor filter and hope to engage with others on ideas to help grow this tool. I go into much more detail into the ideas behind the Attractor in my book I am wrapping up so stay tuned.
