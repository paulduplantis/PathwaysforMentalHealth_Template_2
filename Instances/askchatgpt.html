    <h1>ASK ChatGPT</h1>
    <p>Generative AI is a tool. It should be used as such. My thoughts are that if we use generative AI as a wizard we are going to get warlocks so be mindful what you ask and as with anything in life double check the answer.

This portion of the framework will evolve to become more of an integrated feature but for right now it will remain a standalone.
