    <p>*This site is for demo purposes only and is not a fully functioning website currently.</p>
<p>
Pathways for Mental Health is built off the Deep Inquiry Framework which is a tool to help engage people more purposely online with each other, with services, with products, and with events. Any solution built off of the Deep Inquiry Framework will carry the Deep Inquiry Framework link on the footer designating it as a free and open source solution. Visit the link to read about the full list of principles designating a deep inquiry framework solution. <br><br>

All the code found on this Pathway site as well as any other framework site is available to copy at the Github repository found here.
 <br><br>
The mission of Pathways for Mental Health is to provide a framework for communities to build deep and resonant connections within to foster better mental health for all. Communities of people looking for help and people looking to help built on trust and understanding.
 <br><br>
Pathways Mental Health Advocates are the helpers available to engage with those in need to listen and help understand their struggles and situations to uncover ideas and resources to build their pathway for better mental health. 
 <br><br>
Pathways Participants are those looking for help whose identity and privacy are important to protect which is why they are never tracked through cookies or site logins. Should they choose to engage with a Mental Health Advocate online they will connect through a solid pod data store that not only maintains the privacy of their engagement, but also their activity on the pathways site.
 <br><br>
The goal is for the pathways site to align advocates, participants and resources through what is called an attractor, which is effectively a filter to discover content. It is planned for this attractor feature to evolve through the efforts of the free and open source community and will become an integral part of the alignment process overtime.
 <br><br>
Another key feature of the Pathway site will be the use of Solid PODS, which are personal data stores to allow advocates and participants to share information in a private exchange allowing both sides control over how they want the data they create or consume to be handled online. No information or activity on any Deep Inquiry Framework branded site will be available to anyone or entity other than the creator and users of the data. 
 <br><br>
And most importantly, Pathways for Mental Health is not a platform. It is a framework that will be made available to communities to customize for their own needs. This is the essence of the framework which is intended to be built from the bottom up from the experiences of the people rather than from corporate or institutional edicts. </p>
