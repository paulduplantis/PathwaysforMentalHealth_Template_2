    <p>
What exactly is a Deep Inquiry Framework? 
<br>
It is a free and open source framework to build web applications to allow for the deep discovery and sharing of information without using traditional tactics to influence users found on websites and applications currently. The focus of the framework is to provide a foundation for collaboration across the free and open source community to build solutions across the web to encourage quality engagement between creators and curators of experiences and consumers of it. <br><br>

At the time of publishing this book, both DIFs will more than likely be a fairly basic representation of solutions built off the Deep Inquiry Framework, that what will evolve to. It is my deepest desire that people from the open source community and creatives such as myself hungry to harness Gen AI take the pilot templates and expand on the ideas contained within this writing.
<br><br>
All of the code for this first DIFs will be available to copy and revise and use at will on my Github repository. There is a link on the footer of all pages with the DIF logo. By keeping this link on the site means the following principles are agreed to:
<br><br>
*Built on FOSS (Free and Open Software) Principles<br>
*No Logins required other than for private exchanges<br>
*No behavioral tracking<br>
No cookies stored in client devices <br>
*No popups <br>
*No third party ad networks<br>
*No third party platform integration<br>
*Advanced filtering used to provide user agency over content<br>
*Advanced sharing built as a feature
<br><br>
Any DIF site built in the future, not adhering to these principles, will have the link deactivated.
<br><br>
What is the benefit of carrying a DIF link on a site? Not much other than a declaration that you are following the principles to fight for a more open web that is not in the business of mining attention for profit. It will not affect you being able to engage with the GitHub repository or to use future code though. 
<br><br>
The major components of what will separate a DIF from other frameworks or silos are the declaration of principles but also the curators, the attractor, and privacy focused content management which will be covered below. 
<br><br>
DIF CURATORS & PARTICIPANTS<br>
What is a DIF Curator and Participant?
<br><br>
A DIF Curator is the owner of the DIF who creates and curates content to inspire deep inquiry on their site. They are also the ones to tag content to help structure the discovery process more effectively. As with everything else, this will evolve as I am not sure to what extent a curator will be able to have to paint from a palette of choices for a user to then tune their experiences from this palette. 
<br><br>
There could be one Curator per DIF or groups of Curators! Curators will be the glue binding the DIF experiences together. 
<br><br>
A Curator is also someone who verifies the validity and authenticity of the connections and content on the site. This is the human touch, I believe will make DIF’s standout from the rest. This is not about creating massive directories. This is about creating a focused experience around people and resources to help foster a deeper and better discovery process. 
<br><br>
A DIF Participant is a person who engages with the content created and curated by the DIF curator. They can subscribe by RSS feed or email to receive updated content. As the framework evolves I plan for participants to be able tune their subscriptions through the Attractor feature as well as to be able to privately share and archive information with other participants through their Solid POD data stores. Both the Attractor feature and Solid PODS will be discussed later in the essay. 
<br><br>
When I break it down, what are the types of experiences a curator could collect and/or create to help a person deeply engage with the content. It could be as simple as linking to a review of a product to capturing an RSS Feed or API and flagging interesting content to curate. But as the future unfolds with GenAI, what are the possibilities for a curator to reveal to a participant engaging with their DIF? 
<br><br>
Say you are a curator looking to sell paintings of an artist you are wildly passionate about and this artist focuses on painting cowgirls in art deco style, could you harness GenAI to have a cowgirl character talk about the paintings with your own words to help sell art through your lens? The platform algorithm won’t carry through this passion because it is only focused on convincing somebody of something rather than inviting them into something to explore. 
<br><br>
Ad Networks will never become this creative in the sales funnel. It just is not in their DNA. But Curators could. Not a Curator Network but a Curator Community. 
<br><br>
And there is a flip side to this as well. Not just the fact of the Participant gaining value in what they experience but the Curator gaining value in not only generating income for themselves and their family but to acquire a sense of purpose with what they are offering. It turns out Deep Inquiry is not just for the input but it is for the output as well. It is this process of understanding an offering well enough to put your own spin on it that will drive the purpose. 
<br><br>
Could somebody find purpose in selling something on Tiktok? Of course they could but how does the intent of the platform mold this purpose? Does it encourage deep inquiry for their curation? Does it inspire deep inquiry for the participant or follower if you are using the parlance of TikTok and every other social media platform? 
<br><br>
Hey if you just want to sell something maybe a DIF is not for you. If you want to tap into purpose and sell something maybe a DIF is for you. 
<br><br>
It is important to note that I am not saying the Deep Inquiry Framework is the only path forward for this. Quite the contrary. I hope this inspires hundreds of thousands to build their own frameworks outside the platformed market.
And why do I use the word participant as opposed to follower. Because to me follower implies someone who is not in control of the experiences they consume as they follow the ones who are in control. That is why there are followers and leaders. Participant to me implies agency over the process of discovery rather than being led by it or into it. 
<br><br>
During the Curation process curators share insights against the main item whether it be a service, a product, an idea of a person.  In using Solid PODS these insights would be private messages shared between the Curator and the Participant or even groups of them.
