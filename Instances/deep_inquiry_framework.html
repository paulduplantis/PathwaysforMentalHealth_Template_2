    <h1>Deep Inquiry Framework</h1>
    <p>
What exactly is a Deep Inquiry Framework?<br><br>
It is a free and open source framework to build web applications to allow for the deep discovery and sharing of information without using traditional tactics to influence users found on websites and applications currently. The focus of the framework is to provide a foundation for collaboration across the free and open source community to build solutions across the web to encourage quality engagement between creators and curators of experiences and consumers of it. 
<br><br>
The deep inquiry framework is a culmination of a 30 year journey for me as I have witnessed the web close off into a network of monetized silos. This frustration has been captured in my book The Emergence, which is a collection of essays discussing the communication problem found on the web. The deep inquiry framework is the final piece of the book that focuses on building solutions to answer the problems. 
<br><br>
To launch the framework, I plan on building two different types of instances of the framework which Iâ€™m calling DIFs. One is a for profit framework that will focus on building deep and engaging experiences around business software. The other is a not for profit DIF which I am calling pathways for mental health. I plan on building both to serve as templates for others to build off of whether they are looking to make money or make a difference or possibly both.
<br><br>
It is my deepest desire that people from the open source community and creatives such as myself hungry to harness Gen AI take the pilot templates and expand on the ideas contained within this writing.
<br><br>
All of the code for this first DIFs will be available to copy and revise and use at will on my Github repository found here??  There is a link on the footer of all pages with the DIF logo. By keeping this link on the site means the following principles are agreed to:
<br><br>
*Built on FOSS (Free and Open Software) Principles<br>
*No Logins required other than for private exchanges<br>
*No behavioral tracking<br>
*No cookies stored in client devices<br> 
*No popups<br> 
*No third party ad networks<br>
*No third party platform integration<br>
*Advanced filtering used to provide user agency over content<br>
*Advanced sharing built as a feature<br><br>
*Any DIF site built in the future, not adhering to these principles, will have the link deactivated.
<br><br>
What is the benefit of carrying a DIF link on a site? Not much other than a declaration that you are following the principles to fight for a more open web that is not in the business of mining attention for profit. It will not affect you being able to engage with the GitHub repository or to use future code though. 
<br><br>
The major components of what will separate a DIF from other frameworks or silos are the declaration of principles but also the curators, the attractor, and privacy focused content management which will be covered at length in the final chapter of my book which I plan on publishing once both DIFs have been launched.
